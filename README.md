Chess game made with Pygame and Python ver 3.9.0, Last updated 30/3/2024 but originally made in 2020! The code is from when i was less experienced but i still think that game looks nice and functions well so i have decided to upload it! ðŸ™ƒ

Problems and more ideas I want to implement:
Chess AI bot to play against Force player to move, don't allow them to wait out timer (?) / Change Timer to total play time instead of each turn Add Castling, 
Checkmates and more chess features Point / Score System for players Save game progress incase randomly closed using txt file Total play time clock at the top of the screen
